# CostAverageSim
Use the [TotalReturnSimulation](https://github.com/pbielefeldt/TotalReturnSimulation) to investigate the cost average effect 

--- 

I just realised that with minor tweaks, the Total Return simulation I wrote is a nice tool to investigate the [cost average effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging).



### "Installation"
This is only a script that was intended to be executed with [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/ "ROOT web page").
If you have ROOT installed, execute it by running `root TotalReturnSim.C+`.
